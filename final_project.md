# Final Project
Teams of 3-4 
No teams of 1

## Task list
Each member will contribute 1 additional endpoint + a front end feature. It is up to your team to figure out which features to add. Examples would be adding friends, search for users, block users ect. Bonus points available for styling the app.

Each team member will receive and individual score based on their code contributions. 20% Shared score for the presentation. 

## Toaster Feature Plans
Would like to add the ability to upload or set a profile picture, and also see other user profile pictures when in a conversation
Would have to set a default picture for people who have not set one yet
Not sure how ReactJS handles images but we'll see

Secondary feature plan:
Reactions, similar to discord reaction,
Have some icon appear when mousing over a message that lets you select from a couple reaction images
These will then be added into that message div?

Alternative feature plan if the above does not work:
Add readable timestamps to conversations
Convert conversation display to something more readable current is "Convo: user_user2"
Would like this to instead be something like "Conversation with [not current user]"

Possibly multiple pages on the website

Would like to add some CSS styling so it doesn't look so plain, however main features above come first
